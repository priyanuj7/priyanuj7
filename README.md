Hi, I am Priyanuj. 

I am a Data Scientist with ~6 years of experience in leveraging Advanced Analytics to drive strategic business decisions for Fortune 50 clients across Retail, BFSI and telecom industries. 
I am currently working as a Data Scientist in Customer Analytics and Campaign Management vertical for Etisalat e& UAE.
Previously served as a Senior Data Scientist in the COE team for Consumer, Small Business and Banking at Wells Fargo. 
Prior to this, partnered closely with one of the largest Home Improvement Retailers in the US to enhance customer analytics and campaign management during my tenure in MuSigma.

Proficient in structuring problem definitions, identifying key gaps, and implementing machine learning models with MDLC framework to provide actionable insights. 
Skilled in Python, PySpark, SQL and Driverless AI for implementing Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms.
A hardcore learner by passion.

Welcome to my github profile where I like to put my knowledge of Machine Learning and AI in the form of codes.

I am still learning and there's miles to go before I sleep, miles to go before I sleep.
